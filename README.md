smartcamera
===========

Google Glass GDK app that lets you preview or zoom before taking a picture, and upload the picture taken after zoom to Google Drive!

Main Features 
--------------------------------
* Preview before you take a picture or video, using the Glass camera button; 

* Zoom in or out (using swipe forward or backward gesture) before long press on the touchpad to take a picture;

* After the picture is zoomed and taken, you can view it and tap to a see a menu to upload it to Google Drive (to make this work, you need to download the Google Drive apk at http://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=23212708291680134 and then install it to Glass using 'adb install com.google.android.apps.docs-1.2.461.14.apk') or delete from Glass.

Notes
--------------------------------
Pictures taken after Preview will go to the timeline as pictures taken using the camera without preview - the default Camera functionality of Glass. You can make vignette, share or delete.

But pictures taken after zoom in or out will not go to the timline, but be presented an option to upload to Google Drive or delete from Glass.
